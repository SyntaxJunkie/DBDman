# DBDman
A multipurpose tool for the game Dead by Daylight. Entirely network based, no handles required. Capable of sniffing the game's traffic and intercepting some requests (see features list for more detail).

## Dependencies
* FiddlerCore (can be found at https://www.telerik.com/fiddlercore)
* Newtonsoft Json.NET
* qrypt0r (my library to decrypt/encrypt gamedata)

# Features
* Save dumping
* Getting player level
* Getting survivor and killer pips
* Getting and decrypting the latest catalog
* Locally editing the player's inventory (to give DLC, cosmetics)

# TODO
The code hasn't been updated since last year so a few things may need to be tweaked to make it functional again. Could probably touch up the UI to make it look a bit more appealing.
